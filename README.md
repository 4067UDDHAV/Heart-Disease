# Heart Disease Prediction Project

The **Heart Disease Prediction** project leverages machine learning to analyze patient data and predict the likelihood of heart disease. By combining three top-performing models — **SVM**, **Decision Tree**, and **Random Forest** — into a hybrid ensemble, the system ensures accurate and reliable predictions. This tool is designed to assist medical professionals in early diagnosis and treatment planning.

## Features

- **Machine Learning Models**: Hybrid model using SVM, Decision Tree, and Random Forest for high accuracy.
- **Interactive User Interface**: A simple and intuitive web application for easy interaction.
- **Result Visualization**: Displays the probability of heart disease based on the input data.

## How It Works

1. **Input Data**: Users input patient information through a form.
2. **Data Processing**: The data is preprocessed and passed through the hybrid machine learning model.
3. **Prediction**: The system calculates the likelihood of heart disease and displays the result.
